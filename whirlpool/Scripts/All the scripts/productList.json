With multiflow Technology, a new style of convection system creates an all-enveloping heat flow which pushes heat into every inch of the oven cavity for consistently even, delicious dishes every time – whichever shelf you’re using. Including a Turnspit – a handy accessory that lets you spit-roast your favourite meats for a slow-cooked, juicy experience. And the ease in cooking doesn’t stop there . . . Incorporating Telescopic Shelving to take the burden of heavy dishes, have both hands free to lift them in and out of the oven with a lower risk of mishaps and spillages.

Removing the need to clean your oven ever again, this model comes with Pyrolytic Cleaning. Heating the cavity up to 500°C, the door automatically locks whilst any fat, grease and food residue is burnt to a small pile of ash, ready to be wiped away. Costing just a few pence per cycle, it’s easy-cleaning which removes the need for chemicals. We’ve even applied an Anti-Fingerprint coating to the oven’s exterior to give a resistant finish so the surface is always gleaming and bright. Operated via the easy-to-use Touch Control panel, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven makes light work of even the most challenging dishes whilst freeing your time for more moments with the family.",

Featuring 73L of cooking capacity, an A+ energy rating, plus impressive technology to ensure even heat for an absolutely all-round cooking experience. With Multiflow Technology, a new style of convection system creates an all-enveloping heat flow which pushes heat into every inch of the oven cavity for consistently even, delicious dishes every time – whichever shelf you’re using. Including a Meat Probe to aid you in serving up succulent joints and birds, temperature is monitored with cooking stopping automatically once the probe displays the pre-set temperature for your dish. This helps to prevent over-cooking or cold spots that can ruin a meal. Going beyond just helping you to create amazing eats, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven also brings a wealth of features for easy use. Incorporating Telescopic Shelving to take the burden of heavy dishes, have both hands free to lift them in and out of the oven with a lower risk of mishaps and spillages. The triple glazed, Soft Close door also ensures gentle contact on closing to prevent unnecessary heat loss and temperature fluctuations. When it comes to cleaning the oven, this model features Catalytic Liners – a self-cleaning system that requires no chemicals as special panels against the oven wall catch food and fat spits, evaporating them during the cooking process. For the hard-to-reach area of the oven roof, the Tilting Grill simply unhooks giving you easy access for cleaning, before sliding back into place. We’ve even applied an Anti-Fingerprint coating to the oven’s exterior to give a resistant finish so the surface is always gleaming and bright. Operated via the easy-to-use Touch Control panel, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven ushers a new era of hassle-free cooking into your home, freeing your time for the more fun things in life without compromising on culinary quality.",

    "Description": "Enjoy more of the natural flavours from your favourite ingredients with a little help from the Hotpoint Built-In Oven in modern black (SA2 544 C IX) and its combination of superbly uniformed cooking, impressive 71L capacity and automatic cleaning functions. With multiflow Technology, a new style of convection system creates an all-enveloping heat flow which pushes heat into every inch of the oven cavity for consistently even, delicious dishes every time – whichever shelf you’re using. Ideal for ensuring perfectly risen cakes and breads, plus reducing cold spots in your favourite dishes. Easily operated through the electronic control, with seven traditional and two automatic functions including BBQ, Baking and Eco, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven provides you with the ideal temperature for cooking your favourite ingredients and meals. When it comes to cleaning the oven, this model features Catalytic Liners – a self-cleaning system that requires no chemicals as special panels against the oven wall catch food and fat spits, evaporating them during the cooking process. For the hard-to-reach area of the oven roof, the Tilting Grill simply unhooks giving you easy access for cleaning, before sliding back into place. Experience more good times in the kitchen with Hotpoint’s Built-In Oven (SA2 522 C IX).",

Featuring a 73L capacity, A+ energy rating, easy cleaning solutions, this model includes excellent tech to ensure the most even cooking results. With multiflow Technology, a new style of convection system creates an all-enveloping heat flow which pushes heat into every inch of the oven cavity for consistently even, delicious dishes every time – whichever shelf you’re using. Ideal for ensuring perfectly risen cakes and breads, plus reducing cold spots in your favourite dishes. Triple glazed, the Soft Close door also ensures gentle contact on closing to prevent unnecessary heat loss and temperature fluctuations. A gift for oven cleaning, this model uses Hydro Clean Technology – a short 35 minute cycle which harnesses the power of steam to remove fat and food residue. Simply wipe with a damp cloth after the cycle completes to restore the like-new appeal. For the hard-to-reach area of the oven roof, the Tilting Grill simply unhooks giving you easy access for cleaning, before sliding back into place. We’ve even applied an Anti-Fingerprint coating to the oven’s exterior to give a resistant finish so the surface is always gleaming and bright. Easily operated through the electronic interface, Push controls sit flush against the fascia for simple cleaning as well as a stylish look. The Hotpoint Built-In Oven makes light work of even the most challenging dishes whilst freeing your time for more moments with the family.",

It spreads heat evenly around the oven, which results in quicker cooking times you’ll barely even have to pre-heat either. The smaller oven holds 41 litres It’s conventional too, so it’s slightly hotter at the top which is handy if you’re cooking different dishes at the same time. In the second oven is a grill, ideal for snacks like cheese on toast, or getting your bacon deliciously crispy, there’s enough room to brown and add the finishing touches to a joint of meat too. There is a ceramic hob which not only easy to clean with just a wipe away but great for anything from boiling potatoes to simmering soup. A great time saver is the catalytic liners, they absorb and burn grease at a high temperature, so you barely have any cleaning to do. Another handy feature is the programmable timer. You can set how long the you need to cook for or you can have it so it finishes cooking as soon as you walk in from work saving you time in the process.",
