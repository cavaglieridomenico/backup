# Migration Scripts

This project is used to migrate the catalog from one account to another


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [NodeJs](https://www.example.com)

## Project Setup

in order to use this project, go to the upper folder and run

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll need to open the file common/HeaderComposer and add the API credentials in order of the 2 accounts you'll want to migrate from and to. 

## Project Structure

This project is composed in 1 file per entity that we need to migrate. 
Currently, it supports the following entities: 

- Brands
- Caregories
- Spec Groups
- Specifications 

<b>NOTE: </b> The product and SKUs can be imported and exported via file, so for now this scripts will not consider that part of the migration

## Usage

From the Scripts folder, run 

```
node <migrationScript>.js <accountFrom> <accountTo>
```

Example

```
node migrateBrands reply replyqa3
```

Before doing this operation, please remember to empty the catalog from the account you want to transfer the catalog to!
