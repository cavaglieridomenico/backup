Including a Turnspit – a handy accessory that lets you spit-roast your favourite meats for a slow-cooked, juicy experience. And the ease in cooking doesn’t stop there . . . Incorporating Telescopic Shelving to take the burden of heavy dishes, have both hands free to lift them in and out of the oven with a lower risk of mishaps and spillages.

Heating the cavity up to 500°C, the door automatically locks whilst any fat, grease and food residue is burnt to a small pile of ash, ready to be wiped away. Costing just a few pence per cycle, it’s easy-cleaning which removes the need for chemicals. We’ve even applied an Anti-Fingerprint coating to the oven’s exterior to give a resistant finish so the surface is always gleaming and bright. Operated via the easy-to-use Touch Control panel, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven makes light work of even the most challenging dishes whilst freeing your time for more moments with the family.",

With multiflow Technology, a new style of convection system creates an all-enveloping heat flow which pushes heat into every inch of the oven cavity for consistently even, delicious dishes every time – whichever shelf you’re using. Ideal for ensuring perfectly risen cakes and breads, plus reducing cold spots in your favourite dishes. Easily operated through the electronic control, with seven traditional and two automatic functions including BBQ, Baking and Eco, the Hotpoint Built-In Oven provides you with the ideal temperature for cooking your favourite ingredients and meals. To help you access the hard-to-reach area of the oven roof, the Tilting Grill simply unhooks giving you easy access for cleaning, before sliding back into place. A gift for oven cleaning, this model uses exclusive Hydro Clean Technology – a short 35 minute cycle which harnesses the power of steam to remove fat and food residue. Simply wipe with a damp cloth after the cycle completes to restore the like-new appeal. Complementing this system, the Tilting Grill unhooks to slide downwards allowing you easy access to the toughest spot to clean.

Ideal for ensuring perfectly risen cakes and breads, plus reducing cold spots in your favourite dishes. Triple glazed, the Soft Close door also ensures gentle contact on closing to prevent unnecessary heat loss and temperature fluctuations. A gift for oven cleaning, this model uses Hydro Clean Technology – a short 35 minute cycle which harnesses the power of steam to remove fat and food residue. Simply wipe with a damp cloth after the cycle completes to restore the like-new appeal. For the hard-to-reach area of the oven roof, the Tilting Grill simply unhooks giving you easy access for cleaning, before sliding back into place. We’ve even applied an Anti-Fingerprint coating to the oven’s exterior to give a resistant finish so the surface is always gleaming and bright.
