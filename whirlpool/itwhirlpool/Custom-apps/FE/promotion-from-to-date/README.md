# Promotion from to date

The custom app shows in pdp the message "The promotion is valid from X to X" in case of the product is in promotion.
The app also takes care of showing the coupon, always in case it is present for that product.
The coupon can be inserted by CMS through an ExtensionPoint on a rich-text on the theme.

Coupon development has been replaced by a tooltip (desktop) and a modal (mobile).
