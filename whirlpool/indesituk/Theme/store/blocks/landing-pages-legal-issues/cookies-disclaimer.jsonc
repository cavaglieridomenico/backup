Cookies are useful because they allow the Website to recognize the user's device and allow the user to navigate between pages, remembering the preferences expressed and improving the user experience. They can also ensure that advertisements displayed online are more appropriate and relevant to users' interests.\n\n**Web beacons** – web beacons are miniscule electronic image files that can be embedded within a web page or included in an e-mail message, and are usually invisible to the human eye. When used, web beacons (also known as \"clear GIFs\" or \"tracking pixels\") may tell us such things as: how many people are coming to our web sites, whether they are one-time or repeat visitors, which pages they’ve viewed and for how long, how well certain online advertising campaigns are converting, and other similar web site usage data. When used in an e-mail, web beacons can tell us the time the e-mail was opened, if and how many times it was forwarded, and what links users click on from within the e-mail message. Based on this information, we can adjust the content, products, services, and promotions we provide you to better meet your interests, as well as make you aware of Hotpoint products, services, and/or special offers in which you may be interested.\n\n**Log Files** – these are files that record web activity and gather non-personal statistics about your visit to or use of our web sites. Log files may help us capture, among other things: (i) your IP Address, which is a unique set of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (note that, depending on your ISP, the number assigned to your computer can be different every time you connect to the Internet); (ii) the type of browser and operating system you use; and, (iii) other information about your online session, such as the URL you came from to get to our web site and the date and time you visited our Website. In addition to using this information to better understand how our websites are used, we may use information captured through log files such as an IP Address (together with your personal information) to troubleshoot technical problems, maintain online safety and security, and if necessary, prohibit or restrict access to our Online Services by certain users\n\nCookie List\n\nCookies that are directly set and/or installed by us are referred to as first party cookies, whereas third party cookies are defined as cookies installed by a domain/website other than the one you are visiting.
