### GetOrder
The getOrder API is used to see an order billing address even when not logged in. 
It receives the following parameters: 

| Name | type |Description | 
|-|-|- |
| email | query param | email of the customer who made the order|
| orderId | route param | Id of the order |

If the email of the customer placing the order is the same passed as parameter, the the application will return the billing data contained in the customApp fiscaldata.

### Create User
The createUser API is used to insert a new customer into the CL entity. <br>
It provides validation, if the filed in present, to the campaign field: its length should be <= 30 characters. 

The API expects to receive in the body exactly the parameters that would be sent to the master data entity creation OOTB API.  
In fact, it acts as a validation wrapper aound that API. 

### GetPromoBySkuId

The API expects to receive the  parameters: 

| Name | type |Description | 
|-|-|- |
| skuId | query param | id of the SKU to search promotions for |

With such information, calls the OOTB API in order to determine that that SKU is sellable and available. 
After that, all promotions are retrieved and avaluated to understand if the specified SKU is eligible for that promotion. 

At the first eligible promotion found, the code stops and returns a json object containing: 
- the name of the promotion
- startDate of the promotion
- endDate of the promotion

### GetCouponBySkuId 
The code runs exactly as the `GetPromoBySkuId` function but, when finds a promotion, uses its UTM code in order to search for the coupons that grant that promotion. <br>
The function returns a json object with the coupon code as the single return field value.  

### IsServedZipCode 
The API expects to receive the  parameters: 

| Name | type |Description | 
|-------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------ |
| skuId | query param | id of the SKU to check installation for               |
| zip   | query param | Zip code where the customer selected the installation |

With the skuId, sku details are fetched the the following checks are done: 
- The product is not built-in
- The sku does not support installation as an additional service
- The zipCode is present in the ranges in the ZI masterdata entity. 

If any of the previous points is true, then the API response is positive (the zip code supports installation for that product or the product does not support installation). 

**NOTE** the installation is hardcoded to be the service type with ID = 1

### Get Additional Services Info
This API returns the additional services stored in the SA entity. <br>
It is used whenever the country needs to have Strikethrough prices in the PDP or in the cart for additional services. 

## Master Data Entity UsedÂ
