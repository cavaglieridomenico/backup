## How to use it

- Uninstall the account.log-export@x.x in the working account.
- Install the whirlpoolemea.log-export@x.x in the desired account.
- Remember to update the (<b>App Key</b>) and (<b>App Token</b>) to allow any api credentials for the `delete operations`
- Any credentials are allowed to get the Logs. You don't need to set the api key and token inside the appSettings if you simply need to export the logs.
- Remember that the api key and token fields are <b>hashed</b> through the `SHA512 algorithm`. Inside the middlewares (<b>checkCredentials.ts</b>) you can find an example of method to hash the string you want to hide (<b>sha512</b>) following the same approach chosen inside this application.
